# Introduction

This document is a collection of what I consider to be the salvageable remnants of my blog _poetix_, which I maintained between 2004 and 2017. I have edited lightly, and left the cringey bits in. It may be of interest to people who found the blog itself interesting, and possibly of use to anybody trying to get a handle on what was going on in the bygone intellectual scene with which it was once associated. For the latter, I have included an appendix of cross-references from Mark Fisher's _k-punk_ blog, since that is the most likely starting-point for such inquiries.

The material is organised thematically first, then chronologically.
