## Olaf

<div class="poetry page-break-after">
<p class="stanza">Olaf came to the edge of the water<br/>
he knelt he drank the trees leaned in<br/>
closer the minnows darted away<br/>
from Olaf’s hands and the ripples spreading</p>

<p class="stanza">Olaf washed his wounds brittle with rust<br/>
midges joined him at the edge of the water<br/>
he stretched he sighed the trees leaned back<br/>
in the wind he tore strips of his clothes for bandages</p>

<p class="stanza">Olaf reviewed his equipment<br/>
his map was torn<br/>
he had lost a buckle<br/>
his hunting blade was loose in its handle</p>

<p class="stanza">night came on at the edge of the water<br/>
Olaf lay down at the foot of the trees<br/>
he shut his eyes minnows darted behind the lids<br/>
dreams came humming across the water</p>

Olaf is a “dream poem”, written a short while after the birth of my son Oliver. I had had a strong sense that this tiny infant belonged to a kind of dream-time, that his birth and early infancy were a process of slow awakening to the world, and that in his newness he was also somehow very ancient. I don’t mean that I imagined him to be the reincarnation of some old, much-transmigrated soul, but that he had not yet fully entered time. Without believing in any sort of species-memory or _anima mundi_, I felt that this newborn existed in a common ancestral before-time with every other newborn who had ever lived. (A few years later my grandad Ted picked up a red-faced and squalling Ruby, Oliver’s recently-arrived younger sister, and said teasingly, “You think you’re the first, don’t you?”). So Olaf, who appears to be a Norse warrior of some kind, is my dream of Oliver dreaming himself as Olaf, who at the end of the poem appears to be re-entering the dream-time himself as he falls into REM sleep (he may also be dying).

Olaf in his woundedness and exhaustion seems to blur somewhat into his surroundings, his own breathing mirrored by the trees leaning in and out in the wind. Nature is busy around him, with midges and minnows moving in their own patterns. Much later, in _Cold World_, I made a speculative connection between such human-independent natural processes and the hidden life of the unconscious, recovering from the “ground-zeroing” of consciousness inflicted by dejection. Coleridge’s phrase “the secret ministries of frost” suggested to me that a frozen world could still be in process. You have to trust that something is happening without being manifest, without giving any sign of itself. Olaf’s world is warm &mdash; he is “connected to nature”, as one says &mdash; but it is also coming apart, weakened at the joints, so that inner and outer life flow into each other. The vision here is ecstatic rather than dysphoric, subjectively overflowing rather than withdrawn, like Hopkins in one of his better moods.

I’m sentimental about the poem, and can’t really tell (and don’t really care) whether it is a good one or not: for me it recalls new-parenthood, as a dazed, sleep-deprived, slightly psychotic state which affords access to a strangely familiar kind of bliss.

<p class="stanza">you will stumble one day<br/>
and then we will have you<br/>
straight down the piss-chutes<br/>

<p class="stanza">black vines grasp your ankles<br/>
snails schlupp up your trouser-leg<br/>
waving their tentacles<br/>
sniffing for gristle</p>

<p class="stanza">down with the stalagtites<br/>
up with the stalagmites<br/>
in the ghastly quarter-light<br/>

## Oh Graving Faces

### i)

<div class="poetry">
a black swan he says<br/>
give us a black swan<br/>
easy<br/>
easy now<br/>
no need to stir up the agon<br/>
<br/>
over what very well might<br/>
be nothing<br/>
a white<br/>
swan on black water<br/>
drifting<br/>
<br/>
through late evening<br/>
as the light<br/>
ebbs<br/>
and shadows lie down across<br/>
the way you came<br/>

soundtracked with low strings<br/>
with tremelo<br/>
portentous<br/>
or bearing portent<br/>
sinister modulation<br/>

of the air<br/>
enclosing stillness<br/>
the clouds’ high striated<br/>
cirrostratus<br/>
rippling in convection<br/>
<br/>
as the white neck bows<br/>
and horses in the next<br/>
grey field<br/>

shaking themselves loose<br/>

This poem responds to Geoffrey Hill’s injunction, given during one of his recent lectures as Oxford Professor of Poetry, to the young poet to produce something _farouche_ and surprising: “give us a black swan“. It doesn’t fulfil, or claim to fulfil, that rubric, but rather attempts to sidestep it &mdash; rather than “stir up the agon” with Hill, getting tied up in the paradoxes of attempting to fulfil an order to behave unpredictably, it focuses on a very normal thing, “a white / swan on black water / drifting”, and makes it the central figure of a perceived change in, or shift in the sense of, the surrounding natural world.

_Black Swan_ is the title of a fun but ultimately silly film about ballet and sex, and of a book of Nassim Taleb’s I never got all the way through. The latter’s sense of a “black swan” as a surprising event of uncomputable probability is more what I, and I assume Hill, had in mind, although I wouldn’t put it past him to have been thinking of Natalie Portman at the same time.

The “black swan” is an event characterised by its inability to be grasped by what Taleb calls the “degenerate metaprobability” of orthodox accounts of the character of financial risk. Black swans show up from time to time in the normal run of things, but appear as unthinkable exceptions from the point of view of a theory of probability that takes risk to be structurally manageable. Hill’s choice of metaphor appeals to us to see the culture industry, including what is recognised and promoted as poetry within it, as based on a similarly defective, because risk-averse and managerialist, theory of literary profit and loss, and constitutionally unprepared for the black swan that a good poem can sometimes be.

The gambit taken by this poem is to treat a white swan, an ordinary inhabitant of nature, as an “evental site”, a being on the edge of the void. It’s also quite simply the recounting of an anecdote. Many years ago I was out walking along the riverside in Tupsley, Hereford, with my girlfriend at the time who was visiting. Evening had fallen, and we saw a swan drifting in the middle of the river. Chloe, who was studying Classics, felt the presence of the Goddess in the situation, and argued quite sincerely that we should turn back and not continue walking through the fields. Something had changed, and we were no longer welcome: it would have been crass and imprudent to go on disturbing the place with our youthful and somewhat quarrelsome presence. Electing to take ourselves seriously about this, we turned about headed briskly back home, full of spooky thrills and a strange relief at having recognised what was required of us.

The title is from _Werships_, a song by the Australian death metal group Portal, which ends with the repeated lyric “Bow! Oh Graving Faces!” &mdash; this seemed appropriate to the manifestation of a supernatural visitor.

## Arthuriana

### i)

<div class="poetry page-break-after">
<p class="stanza">The mythos is as you find it: chauvinistic<br/>
heralds, their spurs snagging in damp bracken,<br/>
yomping from chapel to tourney; roaring<br/>
metal-heads clashing amid pennants. Perfidy<br/>
reversed through jeopardy. Names that are supposed<br/>
to mean something: Bewmaynes, Belvedere.<br/>
An order not sustained and not brought down<br/>
by unruly interventions &mdash; Merlin, le Fay &mdash;<br/>
so much as by its own propensity<br/>
for needless questing; as if each hard-won<br/>
consolidation were the pretext for another<br/>
narrative fling: a voiding of premises<br/>
as of horses, so scrambling to its feet<br/>
to meet upright the panting enemy.</p>
</div>

### ii)

<div class="poetry page-break-after">
<p class="stanza">Ripples spreading from the blade-tip.<br/>
The king’s breath ragged<br/>
among the reeds.</p>

<p class="stanza">Ruin on the field,<br/>
incontinent armour spewing<br/>
stout blood into the soil.</p>

<p class="stanza">The barge drifts<br/>
with its burden: the helmet<br/>
lifted and set aside;</p>

<p class="stanza">the raw hands<br/>
in smeared gauntlets<br/>
folded over the wound.</p>
</div>

Of the two parts of this, the second is I think the better. The poem’s quite old now, and I made a single change to it in posting it here: replacing “ichor” with “blood” (Geoffrey Hill uses “ichor” in a similar context in _The Mystery of the Charity of Charles Péguy_, and it seemed too direct a borrowing &mdash; although given that the whole thing’s a Geoffrey Hill Tribute Act number, I’m not sure whether this wasn’t a misplaced scruple).

The first part comes in equivocally: “the mythos is as you find it” could read any number of ways. One way of approaching the Arthurian mythos is to find it all a bit silly, as _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_ certainly does. But there’s also the sense that the mythos is in some sense _there_, waiting to be found or rediscovered, and that its perennial availability for rediscovery is precisely its _way_ of being there. It “is” “as you find it”, for each and every “you” that might come across it. Of course this notion is built into the mythos itself, with Arthur and his knights asleep in Avalon awaiting the moment of need when they must re-awaken. This is a bit of a late addition to the story (attributed to Geoffrey of Monmouth), a kind of self-mythologising appendix; but it feeds into all kinds of things from _That Hideous Strength_ (which recalls Merlin from the grave to combat a particularly nasty rebel-Oyarsa infestation) to _The Weirdstone of Brisingamen_. And of course it’s directly implied in the title (itself taken from Malory) of T. H. White’s _The Once and Future King_, a tremendous and, by the end, wrenchingly-sad meditation on war, power and governance. (I owe White, amongst other things, the observation that his Lancelot was “probably sadistic, or he would not have taken such frightful care to be gentle”).

For my children’s generation, their Arthur is probably the boneheaded crypto-homophobic jock portrayed in the BBC’s _Merlin_ &mdash; an excellent series, but one which like so many contemporary “re-imaginings” plays subversively with material with which its intended audience cannot be presumed to be familiar (cf _Sherlock_). _My_ Arthur, I think, is the BBC's 1979 series _The Legend of King Arthur_. Re-watching it now, I’m very struck by how the tone of its closing minutes coincides with what I was envisaging and aiming for in the second part of _Arthuriana_: that late-70s BBC eerieness must have struck deep (although I would have been only 5 when this first aired &mdash; it must surely have been an early-80s repeat?).

The shift across the two parts of the poem from bathos (“spurs snagging in damp bracken”) to pathos (“the barge drifts / with its burden”, an unconscious borrowing from Eliot’s _The Waste Land_ &mdash; “The barges drift / With the turning tide”) accords with how I feel about the myth, I think: the Pythons made great fun of its chauvinistic brutality and face-saving nationalism, but even _Monty Python And The Holy Grail_ can’t entirely withhold dignity from its subject.
